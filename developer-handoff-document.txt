CANDID Development Roadmap
From ConvoFlow Prototype to Production-Ready Platform
Document Purpose: This guide provides a complete picture of where we started
(ConvoFlow prototype), where we're going (CANDID vision), and what needs to be built to
get there.
Audience: Development team
Status: Ready for implementation
Part 1: Where We Started - ConvoFlow Review
What We Built (Prototype)
ConvoFlow was a proof-of-concept that validated the core idea of AI-powered
conversational forms. Here's what was working:
✅ Strong Foundation:
• Conversational chat interface for form filling
• Basic AI form generation from prompts
• Response management dashboard
• Analytics with AI insights
• User authentication (email/password, Google, GitHub)
• Basic form customization (colors, AI personality)
⚠ Critical Issues Identified:
1. AI Generation is Unreliable
• Tested prompt: "Create a customer feedback survey with rating scales and open-
ended questions"
• Generated: Generic contact form with name, email, multiple choice
• Problem: AI ignored specific requirements (rating scales, feedback questions)
• Impact: Core value proposition fails if AI can't be trusted
2. Generic Brand Identity
• Purple/blue color scheme (typical SaaS)
• Standard typography
• No distinctive personality
• Forgettable, won't generate word-of-mouth
3. Missing Key Features
• No multimodal UI components (maps, calendars, rich inputs)
• Voice input button present but non-functional
• No integrations (webhooks, Zapier)
• No team collaboration features
• Limited question types
4. Lacks "Taste"
• Basic, functional animations
• No signature microinteractions
• Generic copy and tone
• Feels like every other SaaS product
What We Learned
The Good News:
• The conversational interface works and users respond well to it
• AI insights are genuinely useful (specific, actionable recommendations)
• The basic architecture is sound
• Core concept is validated
The Challenge:
• We need to transform this from a functional prototype into a distinctive, reliable,
market-leading product
Part 2: Where We're Going - The CANDID Vision
Brand Identity
Name: CANDID
Essence: Human conversations that collect better data
Positioning: Intelligent conversations that build themselves
What Makes CANDID Different:
• vs. Typeform: Beautiful conversation (adaptive, context-aware) not just one question
at a time
• vs. Google Forms: Engaging & insightful, not barebones utility
• vs. JotForm: Feature-smart (AI reduces complexity) not feature-complete
(overwhelming)
Brand Personality
We are: Intelligent (not intimidating), conversational (not overly casual), modern (not
trendy), confident (not arrogant), helpful (not condescending)
We are NOT: Corporate, boring, complicated, or silly
Voice Examples:
• Greeter: "Hi! I'll take care of the questions—ready to start?"
• Acknowledgement: "Thanks, got it." · "That helps—one more detail?"
• Validation: "Hmm, that email doesn't look right. Mind double-checking?"
• Completion: "All set—thanks for the chat. You'll hear from us shortly."
Visual Identity
Color Palette:
• Primary: Candid Coral (#F56A4D) - CTAs, highlights, conversational cues
• Secondary: Kind Teal (#2EB7A7) - Secondary buttons, links, charts
• Ink: Night (#121316), Soft Slate (#2B2F36) - Text
• Backgrounds: Cloud (#F7F8FA), Mica (#E9ECF1)
• Accents: Sunny Lime (#A3E635) - Success, Amber Glow (#F59E0B) - Attention, Rose
(#FCA5A5) - Errors
Typography:
• Headings: DM Sans (700/600)
• Body: Inter (400/500)
• Code/Data: Fira Mono (400/500)
Visual Signature:
• Minimal dual speech bubble glyph forming a "C" mark
• Instantly recognizable across all touchpoints
Product Architecture
Candid Studio (Builder)
• AI-native form creation from natural language prompts
• Command bar interface: "Tell me what you need..."
• Real-time preview and refinement
Candid Chat (Runtime)
• True conversational form filling
• Multimodal inputs (maps, calendars, voice)
• Adaptive follow-up questions
Candid Insights (Analytics)
• Actionable AI-powered analysis
• Specific recommendations, not just charts
• Sentiment and theme extraction
Candid Voice (Voice I/O)
• Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
• Beautiful voice visualization
• Seamless voice/text switching
Part 3: The Transformation Plan
This section outlines everything that needs to be built to transform ConvoFlow into
CANDID, organized by priority.
Priority 1: CRITICAL - AI Engine Rebuild
Why This is #1: Without a reliable AI core, the entire product fails. This must be fixed before
anything else.
Current State
• AI generates forms but often ignores specific requirements
• No structured validation of output
• Poor handling of edge cases and ambiguous requests
Target State
• 95%+ accuracy on form generation across all use cases
• Handles complex requests with multiple question types
• Asks clarifying questions when request is ambiguous
• Validates output before presenting to user
What Needs to Be Built
1. New AI Service Architecture
Core Components:
Plain Text
AIFormGenerator
├── parseUserIntent() // Extract what user wants
├── generateFormStructure() // Create JSON form schema
├── validateOutput() // Ensure all requirements met
└── refineAmbiguities() // Ask follow-up questions if unclear
Prompt Engineering:
• Design comprehensive system prompts with clear instructions
• Include examples for each question type
• Add validation rules for structured output
• Implement fallback logic for edge cases
Question Type Support: Must reliably generate all of these:
• Text (short, long)
• Email, Phone, URL
• Number, Currency
• Multiple Choice (single, multiple)
• Rating Scales (stars, 1-5, 1-10, NPS)
• Date, Time, Date Range
• Location (with map picker)
• File Upload
• Yes/No, True/False
• Dropdown, Checkbox, Radio
2. Comprehensive Test Suite
Build automated tests with 50+ scenarios:
Category 1: Basic Forms (10 tests)
• Contact form
• Newsletter signup
• Event RSVP
• Feedback form
• Lead generation
Category 2: Rating & Feedback (10 tests)
• Customer satisfaction (1-5 stars)
• NPS survey
• Product review
• Service feedback
• Employee engagement
Category 3: Conditional Logic (10 tests)
• "If Yes, ask phone number"
• "If location is X, show Y"
• "Skip questions based on previous answers"
• Multi-step branching
Category 4: Multi-field Types (10 tests)
• Job application (text, file upload, date)
• Event registration (date, location, payment)
• Research survey (ratings, text, multiple choice)
• Booking form (calendar, time, location)
Category 5: Edge Cases (10 tests)
• Ambiguous requests ("Make a form for my business")
• Missing information ("Create a survey")
• Conflicting requirements
• Very long/complex forms
3. Success Criteria
Before moving to next priority:
95%+ accuracy on all test categories
Handles all question types correctly
Asks clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
Validates output structure
Performance: <3 seconds to generate typical form
Priority 2: HIGH - Brand Implementation
Why This Matters: CANDID needs to look, feel, and sound distinctive to generate word-of-
mouth and stand out from competitors.
Design System Foundation
1. Design Tokens
Create a centralized token system:
CSS
:root {
/* Colors */
--candid-coral: #F56A4D;
--candid-teal: #2EB7A7;
--candid-lime: #A3E635;
--ink-night: #121316;
--ink-slate: #2B2F36;
--bg-cloud: #F7F8FA;
--bg-mica: #E9ECF1;
/* Typography */

ui, sans-serif;
--font-body: "Inter", "SF Pro Text", system-ui, sans-serif;
--font-code: "Fira Mono", "SFMono-Regular", ui-monospace, monospace;
/* Spacing (8pt grid) */
--space-xs: 8px;
--space-sm: 12px;
--space-md: 16px;
--space-lg: 24px;
--space-xl: 32px;
--space-xxl: 48px;
/* Radii */
--radius-sm: 8px;
--radius-md: 12px;
--radius-lg: 16px;
--radius-pill: 999px;
/* Shadows */
--shadow-subtle: 0 8px 24px rgba(18,19,22,0.08);
/* Motion */
--speed-fast: 150ms;
--speed-base: 200ms;
--ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);

Onboarding "Welcome to ConvoFlow" "Hi! I'll take care of the
questions—ready to start?"
Form Creation "Describe your form"
"Tell me what you need to
collect. I'll draft the
conversation."
Refinement "Refine your form" "Prefer email to be optional?
Just say it—I'll adjust."
Chat Start "Please answer the questions" "Thanks for being here. This
will take about 2 minutes."
Error (Email) "Invalid email"
"Hmm, that email doesn't
look right. Mind double-
checking?"
Completion "Form submitted" "All set—thanks for the chat.
You'll hear from us shortly."
Analytics "Completion rate: 68%" "Completion is up 18% this
week. Nicely done."
Insight "Question 3 has high drop-
off"
"Q4 is causing 37% drop-off.
Try splitting it or making it
optional."
Principles:
• Warm and friendly, not corporate
• Succinct, not wordy
• Reassuring, not condescending
• Helpful, not pushy
Priority 3: HIGH - Signature Microinteractions
Why This Matters: These are the moments that create "taste" and make CANDID feel alive
and memorable.
The Four Signature Moments
1. Typing Pulse
What: Three dots gently rising/falling while AI composes a response
When: AI is generating next question or processing user input
Technical Specs:
• Three Coral dots
• Staggered animation (0ms, 150ms, 300ms delay)
• Duration: 150-220ms per cycle
• Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)
Implementation:
JSX
<div className="typing-pulse">
<span className="dot" style={{ animationDelay: '0ms' }} />
<span className="dot" style={{ animationDelay: '150ms' }} />
<span className="dot" style={{ animationDelay: '300ms' }} />
</div>
2. Answer Drop
What: User's answer bubble drops from above with a spring bounce
When: User submits an answer
Technical Specs:
• Initial position: 20px above final position
• Spring physics animation
• Duration: 200ms
• Bounce effect on landing
Implementation:
JSX
// Using framer-motion
<motion.div
initial={{ y: -20, opacity: 0 }}
animate={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
transition={{
type: "spring",
stiffness: 500,
damping: 30
}}
>
{userAnswer}
</motion.div>
3. Branch Glow
What: AI's next question glows softly to signal it's adaptive/intelligent
When: AI asks a follow-up question based on previous answer
Technical Specs:
• Sunny Lime (#A3E635) glow
• Duration: 300ms
• Subtle, not distracting
• Signals "the AI is being smart"
Implementation:
CSS
@keyframes branch-glow {
0% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(163, 230, 53, 0); }
50% { box-shadow: 0 0 20px 4px rgba(163, 230, 53, 0.4); }
100% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(163, 230, 53, 0); }
}
.ai-bubble.adaptive {
animation: branch-glow 300ms ease-out;
}
4. Completion Delight
What: Tasteful celebration when form is completed
When: User answers the final question
Options:
• Option A: Subtle confetti burst (Coral, Teal, Lime colors)
• Option B: Animated checkmark with handshake icon
Technical Specs:
• Duration: 1000ms
• Not overwhelming, just delightful
• Positive reinforcement
Implementation:
JavaScript
import confetti from 'canvas-confetti';
confetti({
particleCount: 50,
spread: 60,
origin: { y: 0.6 },
colors: ['#F56A4D', '#2EB7A7', '#A3E635']
});
Additional Polish
Reduce Motion Support:
• Detect user's motion preference
• If prefers-reduced-motion , use fade instead of bounce/spring
• All animations should have accessible alternatives
Performance:
• All animations must run at 60fps
• No jank or stuttering
• Test on low-end devices

Questions or Clarifications?
This document should provide everything needed to transform ConvoFlow into CANDID. If
anything is unclear or you need more detail on any section, please reach out.
Let's build something with taste! 🚀





Missing Features:

   * Team Collaboration (Priority 7): This is the most significant missing feature set. The document describes
     Team Workspaces, user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), and collaboration features, none of which appear to be
     implemented in the current backend schema or frontend structure.
   * Signature Microinteractions (Priority 3): While a typing indicator exists, the other key animations that
     define the "taste" of the product are missing:
       * Answer Drop: The spring-bounce animation for a user's answer.
       * Branch Glow: The glow effect for adaptive AI questions.
       * Completion Delight: The confetti or celebration animation upon form completion.
   * AI Engine Enhancements (Priority 1): The AI's ability to ask clarifying questions for ambiguous prompts
     (refineAmbiguities) seems to be missing. The comprehensive test suite with 50+ scenarios to ensure 95%
     accuracy is also not present.

  Medium-Priority Missing/Incomplete Features:

   * Candid Voice (Priority 5): While UI components like VoiceUI.tsx exist, the document implies this
     functionality was not working in the prototype. It's likely the full implementation (speech-to-text,
     text-to-speech, and voice visualization) is not yet complete.

   * Multimodal Components (Priority 4): The UI for an Image/Product Selector is missing. While other multimodal
     types like date and location are supported in the backend, their UI components may need further polish.
